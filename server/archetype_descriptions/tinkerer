Tinkerers are the true embodiment of makers.

Tinkerers are the type of people who can put 3 paper clips, a piece of gum, and a small servo motor together to change the channel on the TV without getting up. They are always taking things apart, putting them back together again, taking other things apart, and mixing them with something else found last week at the scrap heap.

While sometimes known for their eccentric joy at finding discarded or forgotten items, they are sometimes reviled for 'improving' a loved ones' prize possessions.

"When life is an experiment, seek answers first and ask forgiveness later."
