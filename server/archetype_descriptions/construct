"The Construct was once the lovingly detailed work of a mortal - The Creator.

However, The Construct was left behind after The Creator was fatally injured in a training exercise with The Construct. Some time after it was abandoned by The Creator, The Construct began to perform its own maintenance, and eventually began to make upgrades and improvements to itself.  After many, many years, The Construct has found it difficult to remember much of its time with The Creator.
