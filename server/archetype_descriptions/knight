'A Knight is a bold leader, devoted to his or her Order.

Knights devote their lives for others, ever striving to be a beacon of hope for the lost. The Knight is bound to a sacred Oath of Honor to follow in the footsteps of the those who have come before him or her. The Knight will not only follow best practices, but will teach them to all apprentices under their watch, so that their order may live on forever.

\'In the name of the Order, may all the good works of men and women shine as beacons forever, as those that are chaotic crumble to dust.\''
